The RefOG tree is rooted on Hydra_magnipapillata_Hma2.217448 and shows a single orthogroup containing a duplication at the base of the vertebrates.

The newly inferred tree shows the wider gene family and has been rooted at the base of the Metazoan orthogroup that contains the target bilaterian orthogroup and a sister orthogroup. It is in good agreement with the tree from the previous study, but shows additionally the Drosophila and C. elegans that also belong to the orthogroup. This is well supported, the target orthogroup has 100% bootstrap support, as does the sister orthogroup, which also contains its C. elegans & Drosophila genes.
