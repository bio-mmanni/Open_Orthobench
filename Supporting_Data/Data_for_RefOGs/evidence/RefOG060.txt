The RefOG tree is rooted on a Hydra (fresh-water polyp) gene. It does not have branch lengths.

The method for selecting genes for the initial tree produced a tree (v1) with 425 genes of which the target orthogroup was only a small part. A new tree with the best 250 hits was inferred (v2). The inferred tree shows a clear orthogroup which can be rooted on the Drosophila/C. elegans clade. The RefOG from the previous study has also included a vertebrate clade containing Mus_musculus_ENSMUSP00000023400, but this is clearly a part of a separate orthogroup that also includes representatives from C. elegans & Drosophila as well as all sampled species from the Deuterostomes. The true orthogroup is well supported by the inferred tree, with the topology matching well the known species topology and with 100% bootstrap support for the bipartition at its root. 

The intention of the v2 tree was that the tree inference would have been better able to explore the part of tree space relevant to the RefOG more easily without the the extra ~200 genes from outside the RefOG also included. However, the tighter e-value threshold excluded Caenorhabditis_elegans_WBGene00017400.1 from consideration. The v1 tree shows 100% bootstrap support for this being a paralog of Caenorhabditis_elegans_WBGene00007670.1, and a member of the orthogroup. This highlights the importance of a lenient e-value threshold if the orthogroup is to be determined by the gene tree rather than which genes reach an arbitrary e-value threshold.
