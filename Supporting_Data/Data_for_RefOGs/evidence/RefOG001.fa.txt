The RefOG tree is unrooted, it has been rooted on the Ciona intestinalis gene. It doesn't contain any outgroup genes to aid the analysis of the orthogroup.

The newly inferred tree shows 3 metazoan-level orthogroups, it has been rooted on the root of the one containing the target bilaterian orthogroup. It shows that the bilaterian orthogroup extends to the Ptrotostomes, with representatives from each of the species used in this study. The order of branching at the root of the orthogroup does not exactly match expectations, with a Nematostella gene as a sister to Branchiostoma lanceolatum and in a clade with the Ciona intestinalis gene. Additionally, the three outgroup species genes are shown as more closely realted to the Deuterostome clade that the Protostome genes are. This is not strong evidence of the Protostome genes being part of a separate orthogroup for a number of reasons. 
1. The bootstrap support values supporting the topology are not high 2. There is no evidence of a gene duplication giving rise to this additonal clade 3. The clade has likely been incorrectly rooted by the orthogroups used as an outgroup. These ouutgroups are spearated by a particularly long branch (this can be best seen with a Radial Phylogram view). and the intersection of this long branch with the very short branches at the root of the clade of interest is highly likely to be inaccurate. Extracting just this sub-tree and rooting it on the gene from the Ctenophore Memiopsis leidyi resolves this confusion to come extent (v2 tree).
