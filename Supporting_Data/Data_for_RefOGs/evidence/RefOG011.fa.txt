The RefOG tree is unrooted, it consists of a number of clades with the earliest diverging species being Gallus gallus. It has been rooted on one of these clades, although it's not possible to know which branch represents the oldest duplciation. 

The newly inferred tree recovers the whole metazoan-orthogroup back to Mnemiopsis leidyi. It provides a plausible rooting of the RefOG from the previous study and shows to earlier duplications also within the orthogroup, both in the common ancestor of the vertebrates. It also recovers two genes in C. elegans and one in Ciona intestinalis that are also likely memebers of the orthogroup. There is some evidence against the inclusion of these genes in that there is a Nematostella vectensis gene shown as more closely realted to the clade of genes than they are. However, the bootstrap support for this is 75%, and there is no evidence for a pre-bilateria duplciation giving rise to just these three genes as a separate orthogroup. They have therefore also been included, with moderate confidence.
