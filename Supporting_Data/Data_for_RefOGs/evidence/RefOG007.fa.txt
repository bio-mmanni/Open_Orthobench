The RefOG tree is rooted on a Hydra magnipapillata gene and shows an orthogroup containing a duplication ealy in the Deuterostomes.

The newly inferred tree shows the target orthogroup as part of a larger gene family and has been rooted at the base of the metazoan orthogroup containing it. A second tree has been inferred on this metazoan-level orthogroup, which is about twice the size of the target bilaterian orthogroup. The second tree has been rooted on the Mnemiopsis clades, which rooted the metazoan orthogroup in the oriignal tree. The tree provides good support for the orthogroup defined in the previous study. The target orthogroup and its sister orthogroup are both demarcated by genes from the Cndarian Nematostella, and the target orthogroup has 100% bootstrap support.
