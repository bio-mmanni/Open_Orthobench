The RegOG tree is unrooted, it has rooted on the c. elegans gene.

The newly inferred tree shows the target orthogroup as part of a larger gene family and has been rooted at the root of the metazoan orthogroup that contains it. It provides strong support for the orthogroup identified in the previous study. Although the tree shows the C. elegans & Drosophila genes diverging before the Trichoplax adhaerens, Nematostella vectensis & Mnemiopsis leidyi genes this is because of the long branch from the relatively distant sister metazoan clades (from ancient duplications). It has likely intercepted the short branches as the base of the target orthogroup inaccurately. This can be best seen using (e.g. in Dendroscope) the Radial Phylogram view. Extracting just the sub-clade and rooting on the Mnemiopsis gene shows a gene tree with topology matching expectations exactly and with high bootstrap support throughout (see final tree).
