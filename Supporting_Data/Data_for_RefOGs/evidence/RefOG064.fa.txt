The RefOG tree is unrooted. It has been rooted on C. elegans & Drosophila.

The inferred tree identified addtional outgroup genes and agrees with the RefOG orthogroup.

The gene Caenorhabditis_elegans_WBGene00010139.1 appears amongst the orthogroup, but out of place in the inferred tree. A duplication could have occured before the origin of the orthogroup. There are also two genes from Trichoplax, weakly supporting a duplication before the orthogroup. It has been included in this orthogroup, but with low certainty.
