The RefOG tree is rooted on a Nematostella gene. It shows a single orthogroup with three duplication events at teh base of the vertebrates.

The newly inferred tree has been rooted on an ancient gene duplication event prior to the origin of the target orthogroup. There are a number of updated or new gene models within the clade identified in the original study. It appears to confirm the orthogroup from the original study. The clade containing the two Drosophila and one C. elegans genes is shown as diverging prior to the divergence of the Cnidarian Nematostella. This bipartion has 89% bootstrap support. The two most likely possibilities are that these genes belong to the target bilaterian orthogroup or they belong to the sister orthogroup (containing 
Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000347942). The previous study identified the genes as part of the target orthogroup. The 86% bootstrap support is in favour of this, although the toplogy of the tree suggests the opposite could be the case (with bootstrap support less than or equal to 10%). The gene have been assigned to the RefOG, as per the previous study but this is with low certainty.
