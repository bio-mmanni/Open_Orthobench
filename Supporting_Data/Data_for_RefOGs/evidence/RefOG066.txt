The RefOG tree was unrooted. It has been rooted on the Nematostella gene.

The inferred tree supports the RefOG tree. A Trichoplax and Nematostella gene are show within the clade, suggesting they mark the extent of the orthogroup. There isn't evidence for these genes being the result of duplication and selective loss, whereas many gene trees fail to correctly resolve the relationships of genes from these species--the exact topology of the species tree around the base of the Metazoa continues to be further refined by studies with larger species and gene sampling. The Trichoplax gene is concerning since it has high bootstrap support, but the topology of the tree above this strongly supports this gene being an incorrect insertion into an otherwise single-copy clade of genes rather than a duplication. For this reason it is relatively likely that these genes do belong to the orthogroup, as proposed by the original study.
