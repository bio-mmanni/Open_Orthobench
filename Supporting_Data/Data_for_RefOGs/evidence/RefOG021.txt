The RefOG tree is unrooted. It was rooted on the branch separating the Mus/Rattus genes from the remainder. 

There are many homologous genes and there is no apparent evidence that only these 6 genes make up an orthogroup. The inferred tree shows at least three clades of genes that appear to have originated from duplications at the base of the mammals, well within the orthogroup. 

What evidence does the original study give for the orthogroup being limited to just these genes?
- Category: Low quality MSA
- Occurs in Eukaryotes and Bacteria
- Protein involved in epidermis development

No information is given as to why this RefOG was so heavily circumscribed despite evidence to the contrary. A new tree has been inferred of 250 genes with hits to the hmm profile with e-values all better than 1.6e-9 from the larger gene family so as to identify the extent of this orthogroup within that gene family. The human gene ENSP00000357789 has been taken as the target since the tree appears to show that the gene Rattus_norvegicus_ENSRNOP00000053315 included in the original RefOG is only distantly related.

The orthogroups was identified as having a low quality MSA and so caution was exercised in interpreting the new tree. However, it was found to give a notably self-consistent picture of the gene family. Working back towards the root from the Homo & Pan genes there are a series of clades with the topology of each being consistent with the species tree and with generally high bootstrap support. This extends to the clade containing 125 genes all descended from duplications since the divergence of the vertebrates from the remaining species. Up to this point this is all with high certainty. 

The next clade appears to mark the final extent of the orthogroup. It contains a gene from the outgroup species Nematostella vectensis, two genes from Drosophila and one from Branchiostoma as well as genes from the vertebrates. Thus, these genes appear to be a separate orthogroup. However, this is with low certainty. The branches lengths are long, there would appear to be moderate levels of gene duplication and loss and there is little structure to this subtree. It may be that these genes are not true homologs. The interpretation of these genes is unclear. They have been excluded from the orthogroup. The same is true of the remaining parts of the tree, suggesting that the tree does not require rooting elsewhere and that those sequences too may be false positives. With that said, the original 125 genes within the vertebrates are all part of the same orthogroup with high certainty.
