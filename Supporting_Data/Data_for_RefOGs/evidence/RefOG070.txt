The RefOG tree is rooted on the Nematostella vectensis gene XP_001631125.1 there is also a Hydra magnipapillata gene XP_002162003.1. There are two further genes from Hydra and Nematostella shown in the tree as sister to the Drosophila gene. The tree has no branch lengths.

The inferred tree shows clearly that this is indeed the orthogroup. There was a duplication prior to divergence of the Metazoa giving rise to a second, sister orthogroup. Both these orthogroups are clearly demarcated by representatives from the outgroups Trichoplax adhaerens, Nematostella vectensis, Mnemiopsis leidyi & Schistosoma mansoni around the base of each orthogroup.
