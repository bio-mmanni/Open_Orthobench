The RefOG tree is unrooted, it has been rooted at the base of the duplication separating the clade with the earliest diverging species (Ciona) from the other clade. This is the oldest branch in the tree.

The newly inferred tree contains an ancient duplication separating two sub-families with representatives from the earliest diverging species used in this study: Mnemiopsis leidyi & Trichoplax adhaerens. The tree shows the target orthogroup within its larger sub-family. The tree confirms the orthogroup identified in the original study and recovers genes from the outgroup species Mnemiopsis_leidyi, Trichoplax adhaerens, Nematostella vectensis. These demarcate the orthogroup. There is uncertainty over the gene Gallus_gallus_ENSGALP00000071704. They are all within the metazoan orthogroup but groups with 3 Mnemiopsis genes. However, its position is variable. In another tree it was shown as part of the sister bilaterian orthogroup. It has been excluded from this RefOG but with low certainty.
