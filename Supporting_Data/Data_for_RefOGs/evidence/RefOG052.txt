The RefOG has been rooted on the branch separating the mammals from Danio/Tertraodon.

The inferred tree shows that this clade reaches back further, to the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. It has been rooted on this clade. One of the sister orthogroups is also demarcated by the outgroup species Trichoplax adhaerens. The tree shows, wiht 100% bootstrap support, that the orthogroup contains an extra pair of genes from Danio & Tertrodon and a gene from Ciona.
