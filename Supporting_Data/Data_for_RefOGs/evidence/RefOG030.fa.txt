The RefOG tree has three genes from Nematostella/Hydra on which it is rooted.

The newly inferred tree has a number of outgroup genes delineating it, strethcing back to Mnemiopsis leidyi. It has been rooted at the base of this metazoan orthogroup, on the duplication separating it from a homologous orthogroup. There is a Nematostella vectensis gene (EDO34323) in the outgroup part of the tree on a particularly long branch. It doesn't appear to have detrementally affected the tree and the toplogy of the target clade, particularly around its root, is as expected. The tree clearly confirms the RefOG from the original study.
