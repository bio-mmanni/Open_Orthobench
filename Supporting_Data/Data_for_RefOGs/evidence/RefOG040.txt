The RefOG tree has been rooted on the Drosophila gene.

The inferred tree recovers a number of metazoan orthogroups. It has been rooted on the duplication branch separating the target orthogroup and its (presumably) two closest sister orthogroups from the remaining orthogroups. It agrees with the original RefOG orthogroup with numerous outgroup species demarcating the clade.
