The RefOG tree has been rooted on the Drosophila gene.

The inferred tree recovers a number of metazoan orthogroups. It has been rooted on the duplication branch separating the target orthogroup and it's (presumably) two closest sister orthogroups from the remaining orthogroups. It agrees with the original RefOG orthogroup with nuemrous outgroup species demarcating the clade.
