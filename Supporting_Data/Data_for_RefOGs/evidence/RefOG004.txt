The RefOG tree is rooted on a Hydra gene and shows a bilaterian orthogroup with mostly single-copy genes.

The newly inferred tree contains a single gene from the outgroup species and has been rooted on that. It shows two bilaterian level orthogroups. The branch leading to the target orthogroup is comparatively long, but both these orthogroups appear to be individually rooted correctly and the tree appears to be reliable for the analysis of the target orthogroup. It gives good agreement with the orthogroup identified in the original study.
