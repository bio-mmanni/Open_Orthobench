The RefOG tree is rooted on a Hydra gene. The tree is confusing, it shows two clades separated with one of them containing a Drosophila gene. The tree makes sense as a single orthogroup if the Drosophila gene is misplaced and actually diverged prior to the duplication. All the relevant branches that suggest otherwise have low bootstrap support.

The newly inferred tree has been rooted on a well-defined metazoan orthogroup that has 100% bootstrap support. The target orthogroup is within a metazoan clade with 98% bootstrap support and largely agrees with the RefOG from the original study. The Drosophila gene diverges prior to the duplication, which is more parsimonious. There are two genes with uncertain membership since they are shown diverging before the outgroup species: Tetraodon_nigroviridis_ENSTNIP00000006920 & Caenorhabditis_elegans_WBGene00002783.1. The orthogroup already includes the Tetraodon genes which would be expected in each of the clades within the orthogroup. The tree gives 94% bootstrap support for these genes not being members of the orthogroup. The have been excluded, but with low certainty.
