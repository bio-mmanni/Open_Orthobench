The RefOG tree is rooted on Hydra_magnipapillata_Hma2.224352. 

The newly inferred tree was rooted on the earliest diverging outgroup gene, Mnemiopsis_leidyi_ML00976a-PA. It confirmed the orthogroup from the original study. There are few AA substitutions within the mammalian clade, emphasising the length of the branches for Canis_familiaris_ENSCAFP00000031345, 	Rattus_norvegicus_ENSRNOP00000005511, Pan_troglodytes_ENSPTRP00000091393 but the actual branch length for this clade is not long and the hmm profile search showed these genes to be homologous with high certainty & similar to the orther genes in the orthogroup.
