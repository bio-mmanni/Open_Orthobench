The RefOG tree is rooted on Nematostella, it has no branch lengths.

The newly inferred tree covers numerous orthogroups within the gene family. The target orthogroup has a number of outgroup genes from earlier diverging Metazoa, it has been rooted on a bipartitions with 99% support representing a duplication which separates this and 2 further metazoan orthogroups from the rest of the gene family. The tree shows outgroup genes for both the target orthogroup and the adjacent orthogroup (containing Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000481105), confirming the delineation of the orthogroup from the original study. There is a Ciona gene outside of this clade in the tree for this orthogroup. The evidence that it does not belong in the target orthogroup is that there is a bipartition with 60% bootstrap support separating it from the orthogroup and the tree also shows that there have been many duplications within this family near the base of the Metazoa, so its position within the tree is not unreasonable. It could also potentially belong to one of the neighbouring clades.
