Key Analysis
============
The RefOG tree is unrooted. It has been rooted on the Tetraodon gene.

Searching for genes for the tree revealed some uncertainty over which genes should and should not be included in the gene tree. In most RefOGs an e-value of 0.001 has been used. All members of the orthogroups have comfortably obtained a hit to the hmmer profile at least this good. For this orthogroup this doesn't appear to be the case.

The gene sequences are very short and the range of e-values is continuous suggesting that there could be many true positive hits at high e-values. On the other hand, adding non-homologous sequences to the tree will force the tree to place these non-homologous genes somewhere (they may be detectable as misplaced) and could affect the position of other genes (this is more troubling and harder to detect).

The number of hits achieved at different e-values:
54 for 0.001 - v1 
58 for 0.01 
67 for 0.1 - v2
107 for 0.99 

From the trees there are 19 genes clearly within the orthogroup. This increases to 23 when including a clade with an uncertain relationship to the orthogroup (v1). The membership of the main clade of 23 genes does not change as the e-value cut-off is changed from 1e-3 to 0.99. The second clade (Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000220812) expands to give a reliable, separate clade of genes when an e-value of 0.1 is used. It is unclear what the relationship is between the two clades--this needs to be established. The tree also shows many duplicates in Branchiostoma lanceolatum, an in-group species that diverged early within the in-group clade added to the analysis to aid the investigating of the orthogroups. It has been rooted on this clade of genes. This is the ealiest diverging species in the family other than a Nematostella vectensis gene. This species is an outgroup and is nested within the Branchiostoma clade of genes. Rooting on this gene instead would not affect the interpretation. Trees v1 & v2 have been rooted on the branch separating the Branchiostoma clade from the remaining genes. This is not to suggest this is the root, which has not been established, all that is asserted at this point is that the root lies outside of the main clade of 23 genes, which is sufficient for the analysis.

Because of uncertainty over which genes to include in the tree, a new HMM profile was inferred based only around those genes which are clearly members of the orthogroup. The scores/e-values for the hits will then give an indication of how closely the genes are to this clade. The 19 genes in the two clades around ENSP00000295619 and ENSP00000271331 were aligned using mafft linis and a hmm profile built. This was searched against the protoemes and genes achieving an e-value of 0.1 or better were included in the tree. 52 genes hit this profile with e>=0.001 and 87 with e>=0.1 (remember, the sequences are about 110 AA long so e-values will be low. The e<=0.001 tree was missing a number of crucial genes (for example, the clade around Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000220812 was incomplete) and so the e<=0.1 was used. This is tree v9.

The rooting of this tree will affect the interpretation. It has two outgroup genes and two Drosophila genes. For the rooting, the tree can be viewed, unrooted, in three parts. Part A contains the two vertebrate clades already identified as clearly members of the target orthogroup (around ENSP00000271331 & ENSP00000295619). Part B contains a large number of Branchiostoma genes & a gene from Mnemiopsis. Part C contains a set of vertebrate genes containing 3 human genes. The root can clearly be excluded from A. It's unlikely to be in B for two reasons. 

Firstly, the gene tree makes a lot more sense with the root at the base of C as it then shows an ancient duplication, and then in one half the divergence of the Branchiostoma clade B from the vertebrate clade A while in the other half Drosophila diverges first then there are a series of Deutrostome clades. It topology is not perfect in this case: Drosophila_melanogaster_FBpp0072926 is in the Branchiostoma clade and Mnemiopsis_leidyi_ML070257a-PA appears in a location within the putative target orthogroup (most likely, its position should be shifted a short distance in the unrooted tree to lie just inside the C clade rather than just inside the B clade). If the root were within the B clade there is no logical interpretation of the tree. At best, the root would be on the Mnemiopsis gene and the Branchiostoma clade would diverge first and then there would be a gene duplication event giving rise to clades with a Drosophila gene at the base of one of them.

Secondly, the hmmer search suggested that the Branchiostoma clade of genes is a lot more closely related to Clade A than any of the Clade C genes are to Clade A. As such, the rooting on Clade C has been taken as the most probable. 

The rooted tree shows the two vertebrate clades of A as clear members of the orthogroup, as before. The Branchiostoma genes are also part of the orthogroup, although these are only here to help resolve the trees, Branchiostoma is not one of the 12 target species. The gene Mnemiopsis_leidyi_ML070257a-PA should likely be the other side of the bipartition that has 41% bootstrap support. The only genes that are uncertain are Tetraodon_nigroviridis_ENSTNIP00000006119 & Drosophila_melanogaster_FBpp0072926 which are both shown by the tree as memembers of the orthogroup, but with poor support. The gene Drosophila_melanogaster_FBpp0309033 is also of interest, it is in a logical place within the tree for NOT being part of the orthogroup but by a small disatnace and only with 41% bootstrap support separating it from a logical position within the orthogroup. The simplest explanation is in agreement with the tree--Tetraodon_nigroviridis_ENSTNIP00000006119 & Drosophila_melanogaster_FBpp0072926 are in the orthogroup and the other Drosophila gene is part of the sister orthogroup. ENSTNIP00000006119 would have arisen from a gene duplication event and then been lost twice, once in Danio rerio and once before the divergence of Gallus gallus. All the trees up to this point have consistently placed it in this location.


Complete Hisotry of Analysis performed
======================================
Trees with each of the different e-value cut-offs above were inferred. Only v1 & v2 are presented here, the others didn't add anything to the analysis. All trees inferred here are from untrimmed MSA since the sequences are short.

From the trees there are 19 genes clearly within the orthogroup. This increases to 23 when including a clade with an uncertain relationship to the orthogroup (v1). The membership of the main clade of 23 genes does not change as the e-value cut-off is changed from 1e-3 to 0.99. The second clade (Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000220812) expands to give a reliable, separate clade of genes when an e-value of 0.1 is used. It is unclear what the relationship is between the two clades--this needs to be established. The tree also shows many duplicates in Branchiostoma lanceolatum, an in-group species that diverged early within the in-group clade added to the analysis to aid the investigating of the orthogroups. It has been rooted on this clade of genes. This is the ealiest diverging species in the family other than a Nematostella vectensis gene. This species is an outgroup and is nested within the Branchiostoma clade of genes. Rooting on this gene instead would not affect the interpretation. Trees v1 & v2 have been rooted on the branch separating the Branchiostoma clade from the remaining genes. This is not to suggest this is the root, which has not been established, all that is asserted at this point is that the root lies outside of the main clade of 23 genes, which is sufficient for the analysis.

The MSA (v1) suggests the sequences are homologous and that there are not any problems associated with domain shuffling. The three clades are clear to see (Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000271331, Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000220812 & the Branchiostoma clade)

The inferred tree (v1) reproduces the RefOG clade from the original study back to the divergence of Gallus gallus and with similar/slightly higher support values. It also contains Tetraodon nigroviridis ENSTNIP00000018181, the earliest diverging gene in the RefOG tree, but shows that there are further genes in this orthogroup (in a clade with ENSP00000295619), but not included in the original analysis, which descended from a duplication before any divergences within the Craniates included in the analysis.

As mentioned above, the relationship of the Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000220812 clade with respect to the target orthogroup is unclear. To better understand the position of this clade an MSA of the 5 genes was inferred and a hmmer profile built. This was searched against the 17 proteomes used in this study and a tree was inferred from all hits with a HMMER e-value better than 0.001 (tree x3). This tree will not necessarily contain all genes from the target orthogroup since they will not necessarily obtain a significant e-value hit against this distant clade of genes. 

The correct root of the tree is unclear there are two outgroup genes from Nematostella, with a potential gene duplication event separating them and spliting the tree into two parts. The tree has been rooted on this branch. Either as a rooted or unrooted tree it shows the main clade and the ENSP00000220812 clade are not closely related. 

New HMMER profile
-----------------
Since the genes from these two clades are homologous, but divergence within the family is high the 23 genes from these two distant clades were aligned and a hmmer profile was created. It could be that the hmmer profile from the previous study was of poor quality. Additionally, this profile of diverse but homologous genes should better capture the variation within the family and identify better genes that are homologous. A new, hopefully final (!), tree (v5) was inferred from all hits better than 0.001. This tree has been rooted on a branch which appears to be an ancient duplication, before the divergence of Nematostella. The tree contains 88 genes, all with with high confidence that they are homologous (compare with the e-values & number of hits at the beginning of this analysis). The topology of the tree also mirrors closely the known species relationships. It reproduces the orthogroup identified in x3, namely 3 vertebrate clades, except it also includes the missing mammalian genes that had not been include in the tree inference for x3 (Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000295619,	Pan_troglodytes_ENSPTRP00000072428,	Rattus_norvegicus_ENSRNOP00000015058,	Mus_musculus_ENSMUSP00000032152). The clade for this has been inverted. Is it due to a gene fusion event? The MSA shows that this isn't the case. However, examining the tree unrooted shows that this subtree is fine, it is just the remainder of the tree intersects it on the wrong branch. A very long branch connects the remainder of the tree to this clade, the intersection occurs at slightly the wrong place due to the comparatively short branches within this subtree. Extracting just this part and rooting on the gene duplication event shows this.

In summary, the orthogroup consists of two clades that arose from a duplication at the base of the vertebrates (ENSP00000271331 & ENSP00000295619) and another clade descended from a gene duplication event either just before or just after the divergence of Branchiostoma (ENSP00000433112). This orthogroup is bounded by the gene from the outgroup species, Nematostella_vectensis_EDO42240. This has 60% bootstrap support. A high support value for this branch would have been unlikelydue to the particularly short gene sequence. There is further supported by the sister orthogroup bounded by its own outgroup gene (Nematostella_vectensis_EDO49888) and with 99% bootstrap support.

An additional tree (v7) was inferred to try and correct the inverted clade. The x3 sequences were used plus the additional genes that had been left out in the hmm search for that tree (but still homologous, they were missed because most seqeuences in the gene family have poor scoring hits). This placed the gene Schistosoma_mansoni_Smp_203030 between the ENSP00000433112 clade and the other putative members of the RefOG. This gene had not been included in the v5 gene tree. Since Schistosoma mansoni is a protostome this would imply the gene duplicaiton event occurred outside of the orthogroup. However, the bipartition only has 32% bootstrap support. It would also require at least two extra gene loss events to explain. It is difficult to say with this evidence which is correct. 


Reappraisal
-----------
The problems so far are that:
- the hmm from the original study was poor.
- the search with the new improved hmm only used an e-value of 0.001 whereas the analysis up to this point had shown that true homologs were scoring higher e-values.

A second hmm profile
--------------------
More care needs to be taken in constructing the profile if it is to be used as a way of determining which genes are closely related to the target orthogroup. The trees based on the first profile show that the clade around ENSP00000220812 is distantly related to the orthogroup. A new profile will be inferred based only around those genes which are clearly members of the orthogroup. The hits will then give an indication of how closely the genes are to this clade.

52 genes hit this profile with e>=0.001 and 87 with e>=0.1 (remember, the sequences are about 110 AA long so e-values will be low. The e<=0.001 tree was missing a number of crucial genes (for example, the clade around Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000220812 was incomplete) and so the e<=0.1 was used. This is tree v9.

The rooting of this tree will affect the interpretation. It has two outgroup genes and two Drosophila genes. For the rooting, the tree can be viewed, unrooted, in three parts.

If the root were within the B clade there is no logical interpretation of the tree. At best, the root would be on the Mnemiopsis gene and the Branchiostoma clade would diverge first and then there would be a gene duplication event giving rise to clades with a Drosophila gene at the base of one of them.
