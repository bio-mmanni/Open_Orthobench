==============

The inferred tree (v1) used genes with hits better or equal to an e-value of 0.01. 



There is a further, early duplication still within the orthogroup giving rise to genes in mouse, human, chimp and rat.


Inspection of MSA:


Tree of more sequences:

v5 - iqtree of the v4 tree
v6 - RAxML tree of the v4 tree
(note, both of these have Galls & Monodelphus genes misplaced at the root of a clade. And I've not been able to fix it, perhaps not important?)

Missing?

x3 looks the most convincing, but is still missing the homo, Pan, Mus, Rattus clade (above).
v5-v6 get the complete pair of vertebrates clades but one of them is inverted (gene fusion? No). this goes back to a Branchiostoma gene, as for x3, but a different one.

Why the inversion of part of the tree? That s


Final tree:
x3 members plus the 5 missing genes.
