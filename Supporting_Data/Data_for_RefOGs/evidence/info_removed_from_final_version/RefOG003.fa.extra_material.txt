RefOG is rooted on a gene from Hydra magnipapillata.

The RefOG tree is troubling since the poorest hit of the hmmer profile for any gene in the tree was 1.8e-25 whereas there are 1453 genes in the new study which are as good a match to the profile as this. The RefOG tree only contains 99 genes.

1st newly inferred tree
=======================
A first attempt at a new tree for the orthgroup contained 250 genes. It shows that there are two clades from the original orthogroup that are separated by a large distance and a large number of other clades within the larger gene family. This shows clearly a number of bilaterian orthogroups that are homologous to the target orthogroup, but the resolution of the status of the target orthogroup is not entirely clear. To ensure that there are no false positives (genes missing from the tree that should be included) a new tree has been inferred with all 1453 genes with as good a hit as the poorest match to the hmm profile from the original tree. This should ensure that all relevant clades are captured in their entirety and so will allow for a clearer interpretation of the target orthogroup. If the orthogroup is of a still larger extent then a larger tree can be inferred.

Second tree
===========
Clade A
-------
The second tree contains the genes from the wider gene family. It shows that the suggested RefOG from the previous study come from two very separate orthogroups and a few genes from elsewhere within the gene family. The true bilaterian-orthogroup containing Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000419199 (Clade A) appears to be the best fit to the profile used to search for members of the orthogroup. Approximately 50% of its members are genes indentified in the previous study. It is well-defined by the new gene tree and contains four clades originating from duplications in the MRCA of the vertebrates and stretches back to representatives in C. elegans. It has 84% bootstrap support in the FastTree tree.

Clade B
-------
The tree also shows the second clade that contains genes identified in the previous study, e.g Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000350331. It is made up of two clades which originated at a duplication at the base of the Dueterostomes. It appears to have had at least one or two duplications at the same location. The presence of C. elgans and Drosophila genes in the orthogroup is not clear from an initial FastTree tree, and the full maximum likelihood tree will be required.

The RefOG was built around COG0666, Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (ASB) family of proteins. This appears to be defined based on a family of genes within the Fungi, if so it may be that neither of the two clades from the original study is closer to the COG than the other, or one may be more closely related to COG0666 than the other.

Third Tree
==========
An attempt was made to select a clade from the 1453-gene gene tree in order to do infer a more focussed tree around Clade B. This is challenging since, unlike most cases, walking up the tree from the target clade it is not clear from the distribution of species which branch leads towards the root, even for the nodes closest to the target clade. 

Fourth Tree
===========
The hmm profile that is being used to search for sequences for inclusion in the tree was built around the two phylogenetically distinct clades A & B. Clade A has been analysed successfully with the second tree, but a new approach is required to successfully identify the bilaterian orthogroup for the clade B genes from the original study.
1. Build a MSA of the genes from clade A
2. Build a hmmer profile, this will be based around the target genes in question rather than a composite
3. Search in the original 17 species plus Monosiga Brevicolis + additional Fungi species.
4. Chose an e-value cut-off such that at least one gene from each of the fungal species is included

The extra fungal outgroup genes should aid in the rooting of the tree and the genes selected for the tree should be those most closely related to the target clade.

Monosiga brevicolis has homologous sequences with e-values from 3e-82
Fungi from 5.4e-40
Largest e-value cut-off before all fungi have a representative: 3.1e-27
A cut-off of 1e-22 was chosen to ensure good repesentation from the fungi.
There were 1591 genes in the metazoa meeting this cut-off and 66 from Monosiga brevicollis & the fungi

Analysis of fourth tree:
The tree remains challenging to interpret. There are no clear fungi clades which would allow an unambiguous rooting (at least a rooting that is unambiguously correct with respect to the target orthogroup). The gene sequences are short and this does not provide much phylogenetic signal for the tree inference. Nevertheless, the clades throughout most of the tree and the clades around the target orthogroup are consistent. Moreover, this tree now shows the complete set of genes identified in the original study to be a monophyletic group.

Without complete knowledge of where the root is, it is still possible to speculatively root the tree on a branch very distant to the target clade. Then working upwards it is only necessary to consider whether each subsequent putative sister clade really is a sister clade, or if it instead contains the root of the tree within it. Examining the target orthogroup in this way: there are the 8 vertebrate clades all identified in the previous study containing 106 genes, this is all consistent up to this point. Call this Clade X. The next sister clade (Clade S) contains 35 genes and appears to originate from a duplication before the divergence of Branchiostoma and the gene Trichoplax_adhaerens_TriadP19385 in this clade and is likely misplaced, there is no corroborating evidence for its placement. The next sister clade contains 23 genes. It contains genes from the vertebrates, Drosophila, Trichoplax Mnemiopsis, Monosiga brevicollis & S. cerevisiae. It likely marks a separate higher-level orthogroup. The alternative is that this clade in fact contains the root. That means that the other part of the tree (Clade Y) would be a sister clade to the part of the tree analysed up to this points. I.e. we have (X,S,Y); we first considered ((X,S),Y); as the rooted tree and are now considering ((X,Y),S);. The part Y contains 1493 with many representatives from all species (Fungi & Metazoa) in the study. This seems the less likely of the two possibilities. Either way, both woulod support Clade X being the target bilaterian orthogroup. This is the first good evidence for the extent of the orthogroup and identifies which subset of genes from this tree should be used to infer a more focussed tree in order to confirm. This is important because the tree space for the ~1600 gene tree is very large and challenging for the tree inference algorithms to investigate. A smaller tree will give better certainty. The proposed bilaterian orthogroup has 99% bootstrap support in this current tree and contains 141 genes.

Fifth Tree
==========
As before, and unlike the previous tree, this tree shows the genes identified in the previous study as two, separated clades. The presence of Mnemiopsis & Monosiga brevicollis genes suggest the extent of the orthogroup containing clade A, but with low certainty.

Clade B is identifiable back to the divergence of Branchiostoma. This orthogroup contains a number of duplications in the vertebrates. After this the next sister clade likewise contains genes from the vertebrates and back to the divergence of Branciostoma. It also contains a pair of outgroup genes consistent with this being a separate bilaterian-orthogroup, with both the Clade B orthogroup and this sister orthogroup having been lost in the Deuterostomes.

Sixth Tree
==========
Identification of all the genes that could potentially be part of the orthogroup(s) from the previous tree has allowed a more focussed tree. This contains 195 genes. It has been aligned using linsi and any column with more than 90% gaps has been trimmed (i.e. very light trimming). The tree shows two metazoan-level orthogroups each with representatives in Mnemiopsis leidyi and Trichoplax adhaerens as well as Protostome and Deuterostome representatives in each group. The tree has been rooted on the gene duplication event separating these two clades. It shows Clade A & Clade B to be two separate orthogroups. Clade B can be traced back to the origin of bilaterian and metazoan orthogroup. Clade A, at least in this tree, is shown to only include vertebrate genes in the orthogroup. It is a sister to a second metazoan-level orthogroup with coverage of all species back to Monosiga brevicolis. It is not clear if the target orthogroup here lost all representatives from its earlier diverging lineages or if it should in fact branch from inside what is shown as the sister lineage in the tree. It has been taken to be just the vertebrate genes, as shown by the tree.

Seventh Tree
============
IQTree allows adjustment of the parameters for the tree search. To increase the dept of the rigorousness of the search, the following non-default options were used: 
-allnni         Perform more thorough NNI search (default: off)
-nbest 10       Number of best trees retained during search (defaut: 5)
-nstop 400      Number of unsuccessful iterations to stop (default: 100)

All the trees contain within them three clades containing the following genes:
Clade S (23 genes) - ENSP00000264607 & ENSP00000355195 and others
Clade T (41 genes) - ENSP00000350331 & ENSP00000296525 and others
Clade U (41 genes) - ENSP00000480388 & ENSP00000397655 and others

The relative relationships amoung these clades and with other clades in the tree are not well-supported but instead vary between the trees. This affects the interpreation of the orthogroups. 

In tree 6:
S & U are sister clades, T groups with a separate set of genes.

In tree 7:
S & T are sister clades, U is less closely related to these than a separate clade is.


Summary
=======
Of all the RefOGs this is the only one that cannot be analysed with any reasonable level of certainty. The bilaterian orthogroup corresponding to Clade B has been identified with a very low level of certainty, and has been recorded as the benchmark orthogroup for RefOG 3. Clade A is even less certain.

However, the benchmarks would be better if this highly uncertain orthogroup were excluded and so this is what has been done in this case. 


Reanalysis
==========
A reanalysis of this RefOG was performed. A new hmm profile was built around 48 genes from the clade identified as clearly part of the orthogroup in the previous analyses (human genes: ENSP00000499751, ENSP00000397655, ENSP00000419199, ENSP00000451575 & ENSP00000480388). There were a very large number of good hits. An e-value cut-off of 10^-40 was chosen for a tentative first tree to see if it appeared likely to contain all genes which could potentially belong to the orthogroup. This produced 689 hits. These were aligned with mafft linisi, trimmed of columns with greater than 75% gaps and a tree was inferred using iqtree. The tree was rooted on 
metazoan-level orthogroup that was distant in the tree from the genes of interest. The target RefOG appeared relatively clear in this tree. There were a number of duplications near the base of the dueterostomes and an outgroup gene (Mnemiopsis_leidyi_ML358816a-PA) at the base of the bilaterian orthogroup with 99% bootstrap support containing approximately 52 genes.

The pattern of e-values for the hits in the tree was was initially unexpected. All genes in the bilaterian orthogorup had e-values for their hits mostly between 1e-170 and 1e-260. The hit for the outgroup gene was 1e-63 and for the sister orthogroup most hits were around 1e-45. So far this is as would be expected. However, there were three further clades throughout the tree (but at some distance) with e-values around 1e-170. This was explained by examination of the MSA. Genes with poorer hits had lost most of the sequence after approximately column 590 in the trimmed MSA, those with better hits had not. This explained the apparently distant clades that had been included in the RefOG from the original study to the exclusion of many genes more closely related in the tree. These genes had scored good hits whereas the more closely related genes had been missed in the search phase because of the lower hits due to part of the gene sequence having been lost. The loss of this part of the gene sequence appears to result in an e-value of around 1e-50.

To ensure no true members of the bilaterian orthogroup had been lost due to the e-value cut-off an second tree was inferred with a cut-off of 1e-20, producing 1651 hits. It was aligned with mafft and trimmed of columns with greater than 75% gaps. The tree was inferred with FastTree. No new genes were placed in the clade of interest in this tree.

The only question over orthogroup membership is for the Caenorhabditis elegans genes WBGene00007801.1 & 
WBGene00003400.1
