There are 3 sequences within the input dataset with signficant hits (e < 0.001). These 3 sequences have a maximum e-value of 1e-223. These are the mouse and rat genes from the original study. The remaining two genes identified in the original study have had their models retired, although the evolutionary conservation identified in the original study suggests that there is a good possibility that there are true genes. The new RefOG, for the purpose of benchmarking orthogorup inference methods bbased on the companion input proteome files will include just the three genes exisiting in these proteomes.
