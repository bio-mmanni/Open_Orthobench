RefOG is rooted on the cnidaria Nematostella vectensis. The tree looks clear, although the highest bipartition has bootstrap support of 1%, this is probably not an issue provided all the necessary genes were included. The tree has no branch lengths.

The inferred tree (v1) agrees with the RefOG tree in the broad outline. It splits the Ciona and Drosophila genes out and places them amongst the outgroups species but the clearest interpretation of these is that they belong in the orthogroup, as the RefOG also proposes.

In the inferred tree there is an extra clade of Homo, Pan, Mus & Rattus genes. These appear to be incorrect, they are a clade of a separate gene and shoehorning them into the tree has clearly disturbed the topology. Compare with the RefOG tree. The alignment confirms that this is the case.

A new tree (v2) has been inferred for these selected genes, it has been rooted on the Mnemiopsis gene. 

The RefOG tree is correct here with moderate certainty.
