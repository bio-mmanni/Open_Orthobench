The RefOG tree is rooted on a Nematostella gene.

The inferred tree contains three orthogroups, it has been rooted on a duplication separating the most clearly demarcated of these from the other two. The tree largely supports the RefOG orthogroup. There is a gene in the original RefOG from a separate clade that had not been fully recovered in the previous study (Tetraodon_nigroviridis_ENSTNIP00000019325). The question is whether the duplication giving rise to this clade was before or after the origin of the target orthogroup. The tree shows it as before with moderate bootstrap support, 85%. And the topology and pattern of species presence/absence are both consistent with a duplication prior to the divergence of Branchiostoma so this clade has been included in the orthogroup. It is probable that Caenorhabditis_elegans_WBGene00020557.1 also belongs to the orthogroup. There is 77% bootstrap support for it being in the same clade and there is not a copy of a C. elegans gene in the clade with Schistosoma & Drosophila despite no other putative gene loss events. With moderate certainty the gene belongs in the clade with those genes and has been included in the orthogroup.
