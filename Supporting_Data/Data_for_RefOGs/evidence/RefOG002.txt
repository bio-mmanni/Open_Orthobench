The RefOG tree is unrooted, it has been rooted on the C. elegans gene, which is the earliest diverging gene in the tree.

The newly inferred tree contains a single outgroup Mnemiopsis leidyi gene, on which it has been rooted. This tree appears to show three bilaterian orthogroups. The target orthogroup and its sister orthogroup both contain genes from the the Deuterostomes and from C. elegans. The tree is in good agreement with the orthogroup from the previous study, except that the original study missed a Drosophila gene or it was unannotated in its input data. 

Although both the the C. elegans and Drosophila genes are separated from the remainder of the orthogroup by a Trichoplax adhaerens gene, this is not good evidence for a duplication prior to the origin of the orthogroup and the C. elegans & Drosophila genes being part of a separate orthogroup. This would require a gene duplication event and subset loss of the Deuterostome clade from this hypothetical orthogroup in addition to loss of the Protostome clade from the target orthogroup. The clade with Trichoplax has only 79% bootstrap support, and these short, early branches in metazoan gene trees are often not resolved correctly as can be seen in many of the gene trees presented here. Similarly, the topology of the corresponding species tree has been challenging to reconstruct even when using molecular data from many gene families.
