The RefOG has been rooted on an outgroup gene from Monosiga brevicollis.

The inferred tree contains genes from a number of orthogroups, it has been rooted on one of the ancient duplications separating these orthogroups. The inferred tree largely supports the RefOG from the previous study. There are a number of genes outside the main clade (88% boostrap support) and these have very low sequence similarity scores (hmmer) compared to the genes which are clearly in the orthogroup so it is likely then are not members of this orthogroup.
