RefOG tree is untoored. Rooted on C. elegans.

The newly inferred tree contains the larger gene family of which the orthgroup is a part. Rooted at the base of the metazoan orthogroup containing the target. It has outgroup genes from Nematostella vectensis & Mnemiopsis leidyi. There is some doubt over whether the clade containing Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000418754 is a duplication inside the orthogroup. There are no protostomes in both clades (C. elegans in one and S. masoni in the other)  however the tree topology shows that the duplication predated the orthogroup and the bootstrap support values are high: 98% & 100% and so the orthogroup has been identified as the same clade as the original RefOG. This is with moderate confidence.
