The RefOG is rooted on Hydra.

The bipartitions in the RefOG and the inferred tree have mostly low support. The newly inferred tree has been rooted on Mnemiopsis leidyi.

The orthogroup is easily identified and the RefOG from the previous study is in good agreement with the inferred tree (with updating of gene models).
