The RefOG tree is unrooted, it has been rooted on the Ciona genes.

The inferred tree has been rooted on a group of Nematostella genes (v1). It is in good agreement with the RefOG from the previous study. The inferred tree has two genes inserted within this orthogroup on long branches: Canis_familiaris_ENSCAFP00000051664 & Ciona_intestinalis_ENSCINP00000012544. The topology doesn't correspond to what would be expected for these genes nor their point of insertion within the tree. It is unlikely that these are correctly placed within the tree. The MSA supports the theory that these are false positives. And the hmmer profile search gave an e-value of 5.7e-63 for a closest neighbour within the tree versus 0.0052 & 0.00021 for these genes. These genes will not be included in the orthogroup, in agreement with the original study. In further support for this, a previous tree included Mus_musculus_ENSMUSP00000041113 in a clade with these two genes. It has a similar match to the hmm profile. In this tree, that gene is now in a different location in the tree, outside the orthogroup. These two likely false positive homologs should not have been included in the tree. A new tree has now been inferred without these two genes (v2). A lighter trimming was also used since the available sequence is particularly short.
