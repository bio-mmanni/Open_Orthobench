The RefOG tree is unrooted. It has been rooted on the Tetraodon gene.

Searching for genes for the tree revealed some uncertainty over which genes should and should not be included in the gene tree. In most RefOGs an e-value of 0.001 has been used. All members of the orthogroups have comfortably obtained a hit to the hmmer profile at least this good. For this orthogroup this doesn't appear to be the case.

The gene sequences are very short and the range of e-values is continuous suggesting that there could be many true positive hits at high e-values. On the other hand, adding non-homologous sequences to the tree will force the tree to place these non-homologous genes somewhere (they may be detectable as misplaced) and could affect the position of other genes (this is more troubling and harder to detect).

The number of hits achieved at different e-values:
54 for 0.001 - v1 
58 for 0.01 
67 for 0.1 - v2
107 for 0.99 

From the trees there are 19 genes clearly within the orthogroup. This increases to 23 when including a clade (ENSP00000220812) with an uncertain relationship to the orthogroup (tree v1). The membership of the main clade of 23 genes does not change as the e-value cut-off is changed from 1e-3 to 0.99. The second clade (ENSP00000220812) expands to give a reliable, separate clade of genes when an e-value of 0.1 is used (v2). It is unclear what the relationship is between the two clades--this needs to be established. The tree also shows many duplicates in Branchiostoma lanceolatum, an in-group species that diverged early within the in-group clade added to the analysis to aid the investigating of the orthogroups. It has been rooted on this clade of genes. This is the earliest diverging species in the family other than a Nematostella vectensis gene. This species is an outgroup and is nested within the Branchiostoma clade of genes. Rooting on this gene instead would not affect the interpretation. Trees v1 & v2 have been rooted on the branch separating the Branchiostoma clade from the remaining genes. This is not to suggest this is the root, which has not been established, all that is asserted at this point is that the root lies outside of the main clade of 23 genes, which is sufficient for the analysis.

Because of uncertainty over which genes to include in the tree, a new HMM profile was inferred based only around those genes which are clearly members of the orthogroup. The scores/e-values for the hits will then give an indication of how closely the genes are to this clade. The 19 genes in the two clades around ENSP00000295619 and ENSP00000271331 were aligned using mafft linsi and a hmm profile built. This was searched against the proteomes and genes achieving an e-value of 0.1 or better were included in the tree. 52 genes hit this profile with e>=0.001 and 87 with e>=0.1 (remember, the sequences are about 110 AA long so e-values will be low. The e<=0.001 tree was missing a number of crucial genes (for example, the clade around Homo_sapiens_ENSP00000220812 was incomplete) and so the e<=0.1 was used. This is tree v3.

The rooting of this tree will affect the interpretation. It has two outgroup genes and two Drosophila genes. For the rooting, the tree can be viewed, unrooted, in three parts. Part A contains the two vertebrate clades already identified as clearly members of the target orthogroup (around ENSP00000271331 & ENSP00000295619). Part B contains a large number of Branchiostoma genes & a gene from Mnemiopsis. Part C contains a set of vertebrate genes containing 3 human genes. The root can clearly be excluded from A. It's unlikely to be in B for two reasons. 

Firstly, the gene tree makes a lot more sense with the root at the base of C as it then shows an ancient duplication, and then in one half the divergence of the Branchiostoma clade B from the vertebrate clade A while in the other half Drosophila diverges first then there are a series of Deuterostome clades. It topology is not perfect in this case: Drosophila_melanogaster_FBpp0072926 is in the Branchiostoma clade and Mnemiopsis_leidyi_ML070257a-PA appears in a location within the putative target orthogroup (most likely, its position should be shifted a short distance in the unrooted tree to lie just inside the C clade rather than just inside the B clade). If the root were within the B clade there is no logical interpretation of the tree. At best, the root would be on the Mnemiopsis gene and the Branchiostoma clade would diverge first and then there would be a gene duplication event giving rise to clades with a Drosophila gene at the base of one of them.

Secondly, the hmmer search suggested that the Branchiostoma clade of genes is a lot more closely related to Clade A than any of the Clade C genes are to Clade A. As such, the rooting on Clade C has been taken as the most probable. 

The rooted tree shows the two vertebrate clades of A as clear members of the orthogroup, as before. The Branchiostoma genes are also part of the orthogroup, although these are only here to help resolve the trees, Branchiostoma is not one of the 12 target species. The gene Mnemiopsis_leidyi_ML070257a-PA should likely be the other side of the bipartition that has 41% bootstrap support. The only genes that are uncertain are Tetraodon_nigroviridis_ENSTNIP00000006119 & Drosophila_melanogaster_FBpp0072926 which are both shown by the tree as members of the orthogroup, but with poor support. The gene Drosophila_melanogaster_FBpp0309033 is also of interest, it is in a logical place within the tree for NOT being part of the orthogroup but by a small distance and only with 41% bootstrap support separating it from a logical position within the orthogroup. The simplest explanation is in agreement with the tree--Tetraodon_nigroviridis_ENSTNIP00000006119 & Drosophila_melanogaster_FBpp0072926 are in the orthogroup and the other Drosophila gene is part of the sister orthogroup. ENSTNIP00000006119 would have arisen from a gene duplication event and then been lost twice, once in Danio rerio and once before the divergence of Gallus gallus. All the trees up to this point have consistently placed it in this location.
