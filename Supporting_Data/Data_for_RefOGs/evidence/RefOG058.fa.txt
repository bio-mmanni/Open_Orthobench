The RefOG tree is unrooted, it has been rooted on the branch separating the mammals from Danio/Tetraodon.

An initial tree aiming for approximately triple the number of genes in the tree from the original study (see methods) did not give a complete picture of the orthogroup and so a new, larger tree was inferred with a more relaxed e-value cut-off (v1) with 250 genes. The inferred gene tree shows that this gene family is complex. It has been rooted on an ancient duplication distant from the target orthogroup and near the root of the metazoa to give a clear view of the target orthogroup and what appears to be its most closely related sister orthogroup. The newly inferred tree gives strong evidence for an additional clade (ENSP00000367013) of genes within this orthogroup originating from a duplication at the base of the vertebrates with 99% bootstrap support. There is also a second duplication giving rise to a further clade in the vertebrates (ENSP00000349324). The genes Branchiostoma_lanceolatum_BL08616_cuf2 & Nematostella_vectensis_EDO33270 are most likely misplaced, they have poorer hits to the hmm profile than genes in either of the two surrounding clades. 

However, this is very hard to have any certainty over. Another possibility is that there are genes closely related to BL08616 & EDO33270 which have been excluded from teh tree, resulting in only a partial picture. A new tree (v2) with an HMMER e-value cut-off of 0.0001 has been inferred, this is highly unlikely to result in any false posiitive homologs. As can sometimes occur, this has resulted in a rearrangement of some of the clades. Both v1 & v2 trees need to be considered....

To recap, the RefOG from the original study had 9 genes centred around ENSP00000162749. With very high confidence this is incorrect--there was a duplication within the orthogroup giving an additional clade of 8 genes around ENSP00000367013 also in the RefOG. The question that is unresolved is whether the other gene duplication in the gene family occurred within the target orthogroup or before it. In general, it is hard to make sense of either of the trees in terms of the distribution of the various species in the tree, particularly the outgroup species. What could be ascertained with reasonable confidence from the unrooted v2 tree was the target orthogroup of interest could be rooted at the base of a clade of 93 genes. A new tree (v3) was inferred from these genes. This tree has the advantages that 1) it has, with reasonable confidence, all the genes in it that need to be considered since the clade has been determined from tree inference rather than using HMMER e-values 2) It is no larger than necessary, and so the genes of interest are more likely to be correctly resolved than either of the larger trees, additionally, the MSA is likely to be of higher quality.

The v3 tree can be securely rooted on a group of 3 Mnemiopsis genes (the fourth Mnemiopsis gene is also close to this root). This tree (at last!) is clear: the arrangement of the species throught the tree is as expected from the species tree and, in particular, this is apparent when there are gene duplicaiton events. In these cases, the distribution of species either side of the gene duplication event is consistent as is the distribution of species on the branches prior to the gene duplication event. 

This tree shows, working backwards in time: The original clade A (ENSP00000162749), the clade B (ENSP00000367013) that resulted from a gene duplication event prior to the divergenece of the vertebrates, another gene duplication event giving rise to the clade C (Mus_musculus_ENSMUSP00000119790), one further gene duplication event still in the ancestor fo the vertebrates giving rise to the clade D of 30 genes (ENSP00000498466 amongst orther human genes), the speciation event giving the genes from the outgroup species Nematostella vectensis (EDO37507 & EDO33270) and marking the boundary of the bilaterian-level target orthogroup. 

This final branch has 43% bootstrap support, suggesting that some of genes which have been excluded/included could actually be members/non-members of the orthogroup. However, the remainder of the clades in the tree are all consistent with this current interpretation, indicating a gene duplication event prior to the orthogroup (and prior to the divergence of Nematostella) giving rise to the sister clade of 33 genes, which itself contains another gene duplication event prior to the divergence of Nematostella to result in two other bilaterian level orthogroups (around ENSP00000172229 & ENSP00000266557 respectively). Furthermore, the delineation of the orthogroup is a very large improvement on that achieved in the previous study which included just 9 genes in the vertebrates, with no evidence to support marking those genes off as a complete orthogroup.
