The contents of this directory are as follows

BENCHMARKS - data & script for benchmarking orhtogroup infernece methods
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Input - the 12 input proteomes for the orthogroup inference method to be tested
	RefOGs - the genes in each RefOG as determined by this study
	benchmark.py - python script to calculate the benchmarks for a user-supplied set of inferred orthogroups

Supporting_Data - Data supporting the inferred RefOGs
-----------------------------------------------------
	
		Data_for_RefOGs - The data associated with the inference of each RefOG
		----------------------------------------------------------------------
			sequences - the sets of sequences used for tree inference
			alignments - the MSA for each sequence file
			trees	- the trees inferred from the MSAs
			trees_tight - a tree for each RefOG cropped tightly around the RefOG
			evidence - the evidence considered for each RefOG in determining which genes belong to each RefOG
			low_certainty_assignments - those genes that have been included/excluded from a RefOG but for which this could only be done with low certainty

		Additional_Files
    ----------------
			proteomes - the proteomes for the 12 study species plus additional in-group and out-group species used to help determine the gene membership for each RefOG
			original_study_trees - gene trees from the original study
			hmm_profiles - hmm profiles from the original study for the RefOGs
			hmmer_results - HMMER results for searching the hmm profiles against the proteomes used for this study
			additional_identified_orthogroups - Additionally identified orthogroups determined in the process of determining the membership of the target orthogroups
